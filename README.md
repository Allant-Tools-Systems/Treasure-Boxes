## Prerequisites
### Allant Group apikey
An Allant Group apikey is required to evaluate/test Allant's Consumer Data Enrichment API.  Requests for a (free) test apikey can be made at https://www.allantgroup.com/onetouch-apis/ (a screen shot of the request form is at the end of this section)

Allant also performs data evaluations and larger "Proof of Concepts" for prospective clients.  For larger scale testing and/or enrichment processes, Allant recommends batch/file processing when the real-time api isn't required.
